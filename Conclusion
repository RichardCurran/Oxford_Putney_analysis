Based of the information gained from analysis.py, Putney seems to be the best place for John to live.
The datasets were cleaned and only data pertaining to the time he spends outside each day was considered.(assuming
his house will be safe and the air well filtered). Putney has a lower mean value for each species than Oxford and
so should be safer.
I found python to be be useful in analysing the datasets. Finding any error in the datasets such as unnecessary spaces
or capital letters in the wrong place were easily identified using .unique() function and were easily corrected.
Using .groupby('Value').size() was a useful function in finding negative values that were to be removed.
These may have some significance  to the dataset but there was lack of evidence supporting this. NaN values
were also dropped. I understand dropping negative values and NaN values may skew the data.
Provisional/Ratified column in the data was interesting as the majority of the Oxford data and all of
the Putney data was provisional. According to uk-air.defra.gov.uk, provisional data undergoes basic
screening and are likely to be of lower accuracy and reliability. The same website explains that Ratification of the
data is a "detailed manual check of the data set"; accounting for any instrumental problems as well as considering the
validity of the data by using experienced air quality consultants to review the data.
For further analysis I would use much larger data sets and I would try to work with only Ratified data to obtain a
more reliable result
